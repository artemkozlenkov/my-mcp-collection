# my-mcp-collection
my mcp server collection for daily usage

This repository contains configuration for MCP server usage.

The included shell script `copy_mcp_settings.sh` copies the mcp_settings.json file to the Visual Studio Code user settings directory for the Roo Veterinary Roo-Cline extension.
This enables the MCP server settings to be used automatically within the VS Code environment.
